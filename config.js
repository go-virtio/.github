// Renovate for this organisation, and only this one.

// One organisation is a few repositories, so a run never comes near the five
// thousand API requests an hour a token has. A shared runner over hundreds of
// organisations does, and then it walks the list in the same order every time
// and the tail is never reached — silently, while the head keeps producing
// pull requests and the whole thing looks like it works. That is why this is
// here rather than in a fleet-wide runner.
//
// Each repository extends default.json beside this file, which is where the
// policy lives.

  // "No renovate config file found". Measured 2026-09-03: 77 of the 835
